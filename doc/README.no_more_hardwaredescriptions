FIXME: This doc still has to be rewritten
       This is just the mail i sent to opensuse-packaging@opensuse.org

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi all,

there are two significant changes in sysconfig package:
- /sbin/getcfg removed
- /sbin/hw{up,down,status} removed

getcfg
^^^^^^
Since some time we provide persistent network interface names.
Therefore we don't need to work with hardware descriptions in network
setup scripts. From now on we will name network configuration files
again ifcfg-<interface> and nothing else.

/sbin/getcfg/ was formerly necessary
- to get the current interface name from a hardware description
    -> obsolete
- to find the right configuration file
    -> obsolete
- to provide information about the device/interface
    -> obsolete (sysfs has improved in between)
- to do some special tricks on S390
    -> will move into some S390-package

There are still some other packages which use getcfg. If you are
maintainer of such an package please remove getcfg from it. For
possible configuration files that contain hardware descriptions i will
provide a conversion tool. Just contact me in such a case or for other
questions.

hwup
^^^^
From now on we call modprobe in /etc/udev/rules.d/80-driver.rules
directly. hwup is no longer used and therefore all hwcfg-* files are
obsolete. Since most of these configs contain just the default driver
we don't convert them. They will just be dropped.
If some device needs some special driver, this may be configured in
udev rules more flexible then before.
Module options belong to modprobe.conf. It was a big mistake that they
could ever be written in hwcfg-*.
Manual device control is provided by sysfs:
- to release a device:
    echo -n <device id> > /sys/bus/*/drivers/*/unbind
- to activate a device:
    echo -n add > /sys/devices/..../uevent


The sysconfig package in next beta will still contain getcfg and hwup, but does
not use them itself. 




-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

TODO:
- mail the maintainer of packages that needs to be fixed
- convert all identified configuration files
- write getcfg script, that can
  - convert hwdescs
  - inform the user (also in the logfiles)

- Adopt the documentation
  - /usr/src/linux/Documentation/networking/bonding.txt
    they should refer to our manual pages


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Removed:
- getcfg: ifcfg-<interface> only
- PERSISTENT_NAME


Variables, the will be removed completely:
HWDESC


Problems:
- scpm
- get rid of TUNNEL_LOCAL_INTERFACE
