FIXME: This doc still has to be rewritten
       This is just the mail i sent to opensuse-packaging@opensuse.org

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi all,

there are two significant changes in susconfig package:
- /sbin/getcfg removed
- /sbin/hw{up,down,status} removed

getcfg
^^^^^^
Since some time we provide persistent network interface names.
Therefore we don't need to work with hardware descriptions in network
setup scripts. From now on we will name network configuration files
again ifcfg-<interface> and nothing else.

/sbin/getcfg/ was formerly necessary
- to get the current interface name from a hardware description
    -> obsolete
- to find the right configuration file
    -> obsolete
- to provide information about the device/interface
    -> obsolete (sysfs has improved in between)
- to do some special tricks on S390
    -> will move into some S390-package

There are still some other packages which use getcfg. If you are
maintainer of such an package please remove getcfg from it. For
possible configuration files that contain hardware descriptions i will
provide a conversion tool. Just contact me in such a case or for other
questions.

hwup
^^^^
From now on we call modprobe in /etc/udev/rules.d/80-driver.rules
directly. hwup is no longer used and therefore all hwcfg-* files are
obsolete. Since most of these configs contain just the default driver
we don't convert them. They will just be dropped.
If some device needs some special driver, this may be configured in
udev rules more flexible then before.
Module options belong to modprobe.conf. It was a big mistake that they
could ever be written in hwcfg-*.
Manual device control is provoided by sysfs:
- to release a device:
    echo -n <device id> > /sys/bus/*/drivers/*/unbind
- to activate a device:
    echo -n add > /sys/devices/..../uevent


The sysconfig package in next beta will still contain getcfg and hwup, but does
not use them itself.

TODO:
- maintainer von zu fixenden Paketen anschreiben
- konvertierung aller identifizierter Konfigfiles
- getcfg script schreiben, das
  - hwdescs konvertieren kann
  - den user informiert (auch im logfile)

- Doku Ã¼berall anpassen
  - /usr/src/linux/Documentation/networking/bonding.txt
    they should refer to our manpages


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Entfernt:
- getcfg: nur noch ifcfg-<interface>
- PERSISTENT_NAME


Variablen, die komplett entfernt werden:
HWDESC


Probleme:
- scpm
- TUNNEL_LOCAL_INTERFACE beseitigen
