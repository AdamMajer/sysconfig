This README describes changes in device initialization that were introduced in
openSUSE 10.3

In former releases there were device configuration files in
/etc/sysconfig/hardware. These could be used to load special drivers to certain
devices. If there was no config file for a device the best matching driver was
loaded automatically.

Now we removed /sbin/hw{up,down}. Things are done via udev directly. Device
configuration files /etc/sysconfig/hardware/hwcfg-* are not longer used.

The automatic module loading did not change much. The only difference is that
udev calls 'modprobe $MODALIAS' directly and not via /bin/hwup as before.

To learn more about this topic have a look at these files, man-pages and tools:
 - /etc/udev/rules.d/80-drivers.rules
 - man udev
 - udevmonitor, udevtest, udevinfo
 - /lib/modules/<kernelversion>/modules.alias
 - /sys/bus/*/devices/*/modalias
 - man modprobe
 - modprobe -nv --show-depends `cat /sys/bus/pci/devices/..../modalias`

Module parameters can be specified in /etc/modprobe.conf.local, e.g. as:

 options <module name> <module options>
