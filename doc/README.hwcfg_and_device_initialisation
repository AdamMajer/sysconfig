This README describes changes in device initialization that were introduced in
openSUSE 10.3

In former releases there were device configuration files in
/etc/sysconfig/hardware. These could be used to load special drivers to certain
devices. If there was no config file for a device the best matching driver was
loaded automatically.

Now we removed /sbin/hw{up,down}. Things are done via udev directly. Device
configuration files /etc/sysconfig/hardware/hwcfg-* are not longer used.  (To
be honest, there is still a /sbin/hwup but it changed completely. See below.)

The automatic module loading did not change much. The only difference is that
udev calls 'modprobe $MODALIAS' directly and not via /bin/hwup as before.  If
you want to load another driver for a device now you have to write a udev rule
instead.

To learn more about this topic have a look at these files, man-pages and tools:
 - /etc/udev/rules.d/80-drivers.rules
 - man udev
 - udevmonitor, udevtest, udevinfo
 - /lib/modules/<kernelversion>/modules.alias
 - /sys/bus/*/devices/*/modalias
 - man modprobe
 - modprobe -nv --show-depends `cat /sys/bus/pci/devices/..../modalias`


About the new /sbin/hwup:
Have a look at this short shell script to learn more about manual driver
binding. This script may be used to manually unbind and bind drivers to
devices. 
For example if you want to change a network interface name, do this:
- change the name in /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules
- call 'hwdown <old iface name>'
- call 'hwup <old iface name>'
- check result with 'ip a'
