.SH DESCRIPTION
Netconfig is a modular tool to manage additional network configuration settings.
It merges statically defined settings with settings provided by autoconfiguration
mechanisms as dhcp or ppp according to a predefined policy and applies the
required changes to the system by calling netconfig modules.

Each netconfig module is responsible to apply a set of changes for instance by
writing of a configuration file and restarting a service or similar.

The netconfig tool knows three main actions:
.TP
.B modify
Modify the current \fIinterface\fR and \fIservice\fR specific dynamic settings
and update the network configuration.

Netconfig reads these settings on its standard input or from the file specified
by the \fI\-\-lease\-file\fR option and stores them internally until a system
reboot or the next modify or remove action. Already existing settings for the
same interface and service combination will be overwritten.
See the \fIMODIFY INPUT FORMAT\fR section for input format description.

.TP
.B remove
Removes the dynamic settings provided by a
.B modify
action for the specified
.I interface
and
.I service
combination and update the network configuration.

.TP
.B update
Update the network configuration using current settings. This is useful when
the policy or the static configuration changed.

.PP
The netconfig policy and the static configuration settings are defined in
.I /etc/sysconfig/network/config
variables by the administrator using YaST2, NetworkManager or manually as
defined in
.I NETCONFIG VARIABLES section.

The dynamic configuration settings provided by autoconfiguration tools as dhcp
or ppp are delivered to netconfig directly by these tools with the
.B modify
and
.B remove
netconfig actions.

.SH NETCONFIG VARIABLES
.TP
.B NETCONFIG_MODULES_ORDER
This variable defines the start order of netconfig modules installed
in the \fB/etc/netconfig.d/\fR directory.

To disable the execution of a module, don't remove it from the list
but prepend it with a minus sign, \fI-ntp-runtime\fR.
.TP
.B NETCONFIG_\fI<set>\fB_POLICY
Netconfig defines a merge policy variable for each set of network settings.
An empty policy variable disables any modifications in netconfig.

This variable lists the network interfaces, that netconfig has to consider
as a valid source for this set of settings and in which order.

Except of complete interface names, also basic wildcards to match multiple
interfaces are allowed. For example, \fI"eth* ppp?"\fR will target first
all \fIeth\fR and then all \fIppp0\fR-\FIppp9\fR interfaces.

There are two special predefined policy values which indicate how to apply
the static settings defined in the corresponding
\fBNETCONFIG_\fI<set>\fB_STATIC_*\fR variables:

.RS
.PD 0
.TP
.IR STATIC
the static settings have to be merged together with the dynamic settings.
.TP
.IR STATIC_FALLBACK
the static settings have to be used only, when no dynamic are avaliable.
.PD
.RE
.RS

There is also a special policy setting \fBauto\fR used by default.

When the \fINetworkManager\fR is enabled, that is the \fBNETWORK_MANAGER\fR
variable is set to \fByes\fR, netconfig makes use of the NetworkManager
internal policy and just uses the settings NetworkManager provides.

Otherwise, when the NetworkManager is disabled, the "auto" policy setting
is resolved to a policy "STATIC *".

.SS DNS
.TP
.B NETCONFIG_DNS_POLICY
Defines the DNS merge policy.
.TP
.B NETCONFIG_DNS_FORWARDER
The type of the forwarder type to configure. Default value is "resolver"
activating the "dns-resolver" module.
.TP
.B NETCONFIG_DNS_STATIC_SEARCHLIST
List of DNS domain names used for host-name lookup.
.TP
.B NETCONFIG_DNS_STATIC_SERVERS
List of namserver IP addresses used for host-name lookup.

.SS NTP
.TP
.B NETCONFIG_NTP_POLICY
Defines the NTP merge policy.
.TP
.B NETCONFIG_NTP_STATIC_SERVERS
List of NTP server IP addresses.

.SS NIS
.B NETCONFIG_NIS_POLICY
Defines the NIS / YP merge policy.
.TP
.BR NETCONFIG_NIS_STATIC_DOMAIN " [ " _ "<number> ]"
A NIS domain name.
.TP
.BR NETCONFIG_NIS_STATIC_SERVERS " [ " _ "<number> ]"
A list of NIS servers for the domain with same suffix number.
.TP
.BR NETCONFIG_NIS_SETDOMAINNAME
Defines whether to set the NIS domain using a setdomainname(2)
call. Valid values are:
.RS
.PD 0
.TP
.IR no
netconfig do not set the domainname
.TP
.IR yes
netconfig sets the domainname with the first first interface
and service which provide the NIS domainname.
.TP
.RI "<" interface ">"
netconfig sets the domainname with the value provided in the
settings of the specified interface.

.SH NETCONFIG MODULES
.TP
.B dns-resolver
This module writes the DNS settings into the \fI/etc/resolv.conf\fR file.

When the \fBNETCONFIG_DNS_FORWARDER\fR variable is empty or set to "resolver",
both, the domain search list and the nameserver list is written.

Otherwise, only the domain search list is written - the nameservers has to
be handled by the forwarder specific module, e.g. bind.
.TP
.B dns-bind
This module writes the DNS nameservers as forwarders for the bind nameserver
into the \fI/etc/named.d/forwarders.conf\fR file. Please verify that this
file is included in the \fIoptions section\fR of \fI/etc/named.conf\fR, like:
.nf
options {
	#forward                first;
	include                 "/etc/named.d/forwarders.conf";
# [...]
.fi
You can use the yast2 dns-server module to configure bind as forwarder.
.TP
.B dns-dnsmasq
This module writes the DNS nameservers as forwarders for the dnsmasq nameserver
into the \fI/var/run/dnsmasq-forwarders.conf\fR file. Please verify, that this
file is set in the \fBresolv-file\fR keyword in the \fI/etc/dnsmasq.conf\fR.
.TP
.B ntp-runtime
The netconfig ntp-runtime module does not alter the \fI/etc/ntp.conf\fR file,
but makes use of NTP "runtime configuration".

The list of the NTP servers is written to the \fI/var/run/ntp/servers-netconfig\fR
file and if the configuration changed meanwhile, the ntp service will be restarted
using "rcntp try-restart". The ntp init script provides the functionality to apply
the runtime server list at runtime using the \fBntpdc\fR(1) program.
.TP
.B nis
This module writes the NIS configuration into the \fI/etc/ypconf\fR file and
reloads the "ypbind" service when the configuration changed.

.SH MODIFY INPUT FORMAT
The \fBnetconfig modify\fR command expects a simple, single quoted, key-value
parameter list in a dhcpcd info file compatible format. The keywords have to
be usable as variable name in a shell (identifier).
The keyword \fBINTERFACE\fR is mandatory. The currently considered key-value
pairs are:
.RS
.PD 0
.P
.BR INTERFACE "='<interface name>'"
.P
.BR IPADDR "='<IP address> [/<prefix length>]'"

.BR NETMASK "='<network mask>'"
.P
.BR NETWORK "='<network address>'"
.P
.BR BROADCAST "='<broadcast address>'"
.P
.BR ROUTES "='<space separated list of classless route entries>'
.br
Each route entry consists of "network,netmask,router" addresses.
.P
.BR GATEWAYS "='<space separated list of gateway IP addresses>'"
.P
.BR DNSSEARCH "='<space separated list of DNS domain names>'"
.P
.BR DNSDOMAIN "='<DNS domain name>'"
