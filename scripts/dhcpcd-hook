# Hook script for dhcpcd (the DHCP client)
# =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
#
# It is called when an interface is brought "up", "down", or the IP address has
# changed ("new").
#
# It calls "ifup <interface> -o dhcp", which does the following:
#
#  - set up routing according to /etc/sysconfig/network/ifroute-* 
#    (where you can configure routes per interface)
#
#  - execute /etc/sysconfig/network/if-{up,down}.d/*
#    (where you can place your own scripts)
#
#  - execute POST_UP scripts defined in /etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-* 
#    (see "man 8 ifup")
#
# Thus, those are the hooks where you can add stuff.


#  The following parameters are passed to this script by dhcpcd:
#  $1 = HostInfoFilePath, e.g  "/var/lib/dhcpcd/dhcpcd-eth0.info"
#  $2 = "up" if interface has been configured with the same
#       IP address as before reboot;
#  $2 = "down" if interface has been shut down;
#  $2 = "new" if interface has been configured with new IP address;
#  $3 (optional) = "-d" debug flag passed if dhcpcd daemon has been
#       invoked with "-d" flag
